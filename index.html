          <p class="emphasis">Summary</p>
          <p class="bio">
            My love for coding was definitely something that was gradual in my lifetime. It all started with hardware and building computers at a young age, my first tower at the age of 10. I remember having a couple pre-built brand computers in the house and taking them apart just to put them back together. PC gaming online was also a huge part of my early years and naturally, I became more interested in all things related to the web. My curiosity in building things from scratch transgressed from hardware into software. I taught myself a lot of the basics in CSS/HTML/& JavaScript at some point in high school, crafting very simple web sites and learning the fundamentals of web design.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Most of that came to a halt when college came around. Decisions were made that pushed me down a different road. A long story short, I opted to follow into healthcare & emergency services. Fast forward a few years after working for private companies & still waiting to get onto a fire department, I truly felt unfulfilled, but only in the sense that I wasn't getting to utilize my creativity; it plagued me. I heard about coding bootcamps and how popular they've become in recent years, I started to think about pursuing a lifestyle change. After about of year of serious contemplation, I decided that it was time to chase the new challenge and possibly re-ignite an old fire. There was a void to fill & I couldn't ignore it. Computers & technology were always what interested me the most & that was my strongest motivator in my decision to switch career paths. I started Devbootcamp Chicago in October 2016 and graduated in March 2017 & I can truly say that it was the best decision of my life. Everything I learned from the hard skills to improving my soft skills, it gave me a better understanding of how to be an efficient contributor and collaborator in a software development setting. Looking towards the future, I feel nothing but excitement as my desire to learn is matched by the progression of technology.

          <p class="emphasis">Outside of coding?</p>
          <p class="bio">
            I enjoy outdoor activities and sports. Fitness and exercise play a huge role in my daily routine. Hiking, boarding, skiing, & basketball are definitely my favorites. Other than that, you'll find me teaching myself to cook, watching movies or my favorite sports teams, hanging out with friends, & traveling when I have the opportunity. During times of solitude, I'm an avid writer & doodler & collector of over-ear headphones & mechanical keyboards.

          <h3>Squad</h3>

          <div class="line-break"></div>
          <p class="emphasis">
            Ruby on Rails / JavaScript / Twilio API / AWS S3 / Travis CI / React Native

          <p class="project-info">
            Squad was our capstone project for Dev Bootcamp, built in 8 days by a team of 4. Our idea was to build a mobile friendly application that allows a user to create a friends list and send out polls when they're out and about, needing quick advice. The user is then able to watch the feedback come back in real time via a live chart update. The main goal was for ease of use for users wanting immediate feedback. Being able to send in a response by a simple text without having the app itself open makes it more convenient and less of a hassle to reply to someone else's poll.

          <p class="project-info">
            Round table was a mock client project, built in 2 days by a team of 4 where we practiced client interaction from a tech team perspective. We were tasked to build out an application to the client's specifications, with input from our team. The app itself is very similar to wikipedia as it is a collection/list of board games that people can look up and play. A user can create a game by providing its title and instructions on how to play it. Adhering to  proposed deadlines (MVP showcase) with the client changing requirements mid-way through were also simulated.

          <p class="emphasis">Features include:</p>
          <p class="project-info">
            Registered users can create the initial game and instructions</br>
            Images can be uploaded when creating a game via CKeditor/Paperclip gems</br>
            All users, registered or not can update a game's instructions & rules</br>
            All changes are recorded in a history and can be reverted</br>
