          <p class="emphasis">Intro</p>
          <p class="bio">
            My love for coding was definitely something that was gradual in my lifetime. It all started with hardware and building computers at a young age, my first tower at the age of 10. I remember having a couple pre-built brand computers in the house and taking them apart just to put them back together. PC gaming online was also a huge part of my early years and naturally, I became more interested in all things related to the web. My curiosity in building things from scratch transgressed from hardware into software. I taught myself a lot of basics in CSS/HTML/& JavaScript at some point in high school, crafting very simple web sites and learning the fundamentals to web design.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">
            Most of that came to a halt when college came around. Decisions were made that pushed me down a different road. A long story short, I opted to follow into healthcare & emergency services. Fast forward a few years after working for private companies & still waiting to get onto a fire department, I truly felt unfulfilled, but only in the sense that I wasn't getting to utilize my creativity; it plagued me. I heard about all these coding bootcamps and really thought about a lifestyle change. After about of year of contemplation, I decided that it was time to chase the new challenge and possibly re-ignite an old fire. Technology was always the field that interested me the most and that was my strongest motivator in my decision to switch career paths. I started Devbootcamp Chicago in October 2016 and graduated in March 2017 & I can truly say that it was the best decision of my life. Everything I learned from the hard skills to the soft skills, it gave me a better understanding of how to truly be a contributor and collaborator in a software development setting. Looking towards the future, I feel nothing but excitement as my desire to learn is matched by the progression of technology.

          <p class="bio">
            I enjoy outdoor activities and sports. Fitness and exercise play a huge role in my daily routine. Hiking, boarding, skiing, & basketball are definitely my favorites. Other than that, you'll find me teaching myself to cook, watching my favorite sports teams, hanging out with friends, & traveling when I have the opportunity.

          <p class="project-info">
            Squad was our capstone project for Dev Bootcamp, built in 8 days by a team of 4. Our idea was to build a mobile friendly application that allows a user to create a friends list and send out polls/questions when they're out and about, needing quick advice. The user is then able to watch the feedback come back in real time via chart update.

            Round table was a mock client project, built in 2 days by a team of 4 where we practiced client interaction from a tech team perspective. We were tasked to build out an application to the client's specifications, with input from our team. The app itself is very similar to a wikipedia with its features. Adhering to  proposed deadlines (MVP showcase) with the client changing requirements were also simulated.
